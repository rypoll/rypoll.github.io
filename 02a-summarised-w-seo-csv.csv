"AI Won’t Take Our Jobs (Yet)

Since the launch of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has been the talk of the town. What can it do? What can’t it do? It’s clear that the answer is: it can do a lot. CEO Sam Altman has said that 'AI is very good at doing tasks, but terrible at doing whole jobs, for now'. A recent study conducted by software company Workday involving 1,000 global business decision-makers showed that a staggering 93% of business leaders in the UK and Ireland believe that humans should be involved in AI decision-making. Security is another factor that raises concerns among businesses, with almost half of the surveyed companies expressing worries about the security implications of AI. The impact of AI remains uncertain, but Workday is not alone in predicting exciting new possibilities.","['https://fortune.com/2023/06/08/openai-ceo-sam-altman-ai-good-at-tasks-bad-at-jobs-for-now/', 'https://openai.com/gpt-4', 'https://newsroom.workday.com/2023-06-28-Workday-Global-Survey-Majority-of-Business-Leaders-Believe-Humans-Should-be-Involved-in-AI-Decision-Making-Cite-Ethical-and-Data-Concerns']",27,03/07/2023,07/07/2023,neonpulse <neonpulse@mail.beehiiv.com>,18930731627d0726,"['https://fortune.com/2023/06/08/openai-ceo-sam-altman-ai-good-at-tasks-bad-at-jobs-for-now/', 'https://openai.com/gpt-4', 'https://newsroom.workday.com/2023-06-28-Workday-Global-Survey-Majority-of-Business-Leaders-Believe-Humans-Should-be-Involved-in-AI-Decision-Making-Cite-Ethical-and-Data-Concerns']",3.0,6340.0,,,,2130.0,"['AI in business', 'AI real-world applications']",2023.0,Jul 03 - Jul 09,17:29.8,,🤖 AI Won’t Take Our Jobs (Yet)

Minimum-viable-products allow entrepreneurs to test big product ideas without building out the entire product. Examples of successful MVPs include Dropbox's video demo.
